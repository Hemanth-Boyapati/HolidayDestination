## Introduction:
 This project is based on the idea of planning tours on one go and it will be executed in the form of a website.
## Tools:
 Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, React JS, Bootstrap
  ; Backend: My SQL, PHP
## How we plan on using the tools:
  We are planning to build the UI using HTML and design it with CSS (Bootstrap and Tailwind). And we are planning to build the database with MySQL which stores the         information of all the tour packages, and destinations. We are going to use PHP to connect the frontend and backend parts.
## How it works:
  Our website contains different tourist locations across India from which tourists can pick one. Then different tour packages are displayed, differentiated based on the   number of days of travel, tourists, and different options for hotel stays. We provide different travel options for reaching the destination. We’ll provide season-       specific packages which are provided at a discounted rate. Our website provides cost-effective packages that suit the tourist’s needs and budget. Then we’ll display     the itinerary according to the chosen package which contain the places to be visited, information on accommodation, and travel vehicle provided to them for that day.     Then the user can make a booking request by providing his personal details (name, phone number, email id) and we’ll get in contact with them for further details and     clarifications on the tour and provide them the payment method for the booking. After the payment is done, the booking will be confirmed. We’ll send a confirmation       mail providing the tour itinerary and contact details of us. 
## Conclusion:
  There is a need for planning a tour properly to avoid spending too much money on accommodation and travel. So, we came up with this idea of a tour planner to help        tourists make an informed and wise decision on their tour. This website makes it easier to plan holidays without much hassle as everything will be planned with just      one click.
